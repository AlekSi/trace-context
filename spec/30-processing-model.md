# Processing Model

This section defines the behaviour of a tracing system when a new request is received by a component. As stated above tracing systems can decide for each individual request whether they want to _forward_ a trace or _participate_ in a trace. The processing model for both scenarios will be described individualy and adds a seperate processing model when a tracing system is the first system to start a trace. 

## Processing Model in Forwarding Mode

In forwarding mode a tracing system decides to forward tracing information but to not modify the trace-context headers. The request is then considered as not sampled. 

1. Tracing system receives a `traceparent` header and may receive `tracecontext`. 
2. Tracing system tries to parse the version of the `traceparent` header.
   1. If the version prefix cannot be parsed (it's not 2 hex characters followed by
   dash (`-`)), implementation should restart the trace.
*NOTE* : If a system is in forwarding only mode. It cannot start a trace. 
   2. If the version is higher than supported by the tracing system, does no further validations. 
3. When the version number is supported by the tracing system it validates `trace-id` and `parent-id`
  1. If `trace-id` and `parent-id` are valid, the tracing system adds the entire `trace-context` to all outgoing request orginating from the current incoming request. 
  2. If either `trace-id` or `parent-id` are invalid, the tracing systems does not add the trace context to any outgoing requests.
*NOTE* : We never explictly defined this, but I think this is what should happen. 

## Processing Model in Participation Mode

In participation mode the tracing system decides to forward AND modofiy trace-context headers. The request is then consideres as sampled.

1. Tracing system receives a `traceparent` header and may receive `tracecontext`. 
2. Tracing system tries to parse the version of the `traceparent` header.
  1. If the version prefix cannot be parsed (it's not 2 hex characters followed by
   dash (`-`)), the tracing system creates a new `traceparent` header and removes all entries from `tracecontext`. 
  2. If the version number is higher than supported by the tracing implemenation, the implementation uses the format defined in this specification to parse `trace-id` and `parent-id`. The tracing system will only parse `flags` values supported by the current version of  this specification and ignore all other values. If parsing fails, the tracing system creates a new `traceparent` header and removes all entries from `tracecontext`. 
3. When the version number is supported by the tracing system it validates `trace-id` and `parent-id`.
  1. If either `trace-id`, `parent-id` or `flags`  are invalid, the tracing system creates a new `traceparent` header and removes all entries from `tracecontext`.
4. After the system has validate the traceparent it validates the tracestate
*NOTE* : How do we do this exactly?

5. Tracing system modifies the `traceparent` header. 
1. **Update `parent-id`**. The value of property `parent-id` can be set to the
   new value representing the ID of the current operation. This is the most
   typical mutation and should be considered a default.
*NOTE* : This definition is not entirely clear.   
2. **Indicate recorded state**. The value of `recorded` flag of `trace-flags`
   may be set to `1` if it had value `0` before or vice versa. `parent-id` MUST
   be set to the new value with the `recorded` flag update. See details of
   `recorded` flag for more information on how this flag is recommended to be
   used.
3. **Update `recorded`**. The value of `recorded` reflects the caller's
   recording behavior: either the trace data were dropped or may have been
   recorded out-of-band. This mutation gives the downstream tracer information
   about the likelihood its parent's information was recorded.
6. Tracing System modifies the `tracestate` header
  1. **Update key value**. The value of any key can be updated. Modified keys MUST
   be moved to the beginning of the list. This is the most common mutation
   resuming the trace.
  2. **Add new key-value pair**. New key-value pair should be added into the
   beginning of the list.
  3. **Delete the key-value pair**. Any key-value pair MAY be deleted. It is
   highly discouraged to delete keys that weren't generated by the same tracing
   system or platform. Deletion of unknown key-value pair will break correlation
   in other systems. This mutation enables two scenarios. The first is proxies
   can block certain `tracestate` keys for privacy and security concerns. The
   second scenario is a truncation of long `tracestate`'s.

## Processing Model for (re)starting a trace

1. **Restarting trace**. All properties - `trace-id`, `parent-id`, `trace-flags`
   are regenerated. This mutation is used in the services defined as a front
   gate into secure networks and eliminates a potential denial of service attack
   surface.
