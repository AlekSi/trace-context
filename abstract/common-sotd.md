This is the First Public Working Draft
([FPWD](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#working-draft)). There are a
few experimental implementations of this protocol available, and tests have
delivered promising results. The specification will be progressed into the Candidate
Recommendation stage; following this, drafts for binary, AMQP and
MQTT protocols will be written to make sure the concepts and structure defined
in this specification can be ported to other protocols.
